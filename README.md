# AWS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

This repository contains the Terraform code for deploying our project's infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary goal is to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for easy collaboration, versioning, and management of our cloud resources.

### Team and Responsibilities

- **Phase 1 (Compute):** Colin (EC2 instances and core infrastructure)

### Project Workflow

1. **AWS Account:** The infrastructure will be deployed on the AWS account managed by Colin.
2. **Phased Development:** Work is divided into distinct phases, with each team member focusing on a specific component.
3. **Collaboration:** All infrastructure is to be provisioned using Terraform. Please commit all `.tf` files to this repository.
4. **Review:** We will hold short meetings after each phase to review progress, discuss challenges, and ensure everyone is aligned.
